## Increment myth

Some seem to think that pre incrementation (++i) is more efficient than post incrementation (i++).

Two very simple example programs are created along with the assembly output. When comparing the assembly output we can conclude that there is no difference in efficiency  as they both produce the exact same assembly code.
